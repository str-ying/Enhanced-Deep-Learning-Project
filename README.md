# Enhanced-Deep-Learning-Project

 

Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) has partnered with Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) to collaborate in a research project regarding a novel pooling algorithm that the NNSS has developed: variable stride. This project is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through REU award number DMS - 2050754. The main goal of this project is to examine variable stride. Since it has been developed recently, it has not been used or tested compared to the other pooling methods. To examine this method, a small data set of diabetic retinopathy eye images were given to use to implement into the convolutional neural network (CNN). Variable stride will be evaluated using metrics such as the ROC curve. Along with the examination, variable stride will be compared to AvgPool and MaxPool.
